# Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator.
# Python's syntax for math operations is almost the same as
# standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols
# +, - and / denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect.
# The symbol for multiplication is *.

# If you run a 10 kilometer race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, what is your
# average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? What is your average
# speed in miles per hour?

# Insert Answers
# Average Pace (minutes & seconds per mile): [6 minutes 52 seconds]
# Average Speed in MPH:  [8.73119]

# Insert calculations below (paste from the interpreter):
>>> (10 * 0.62137) / ((42+(42/60))/60)
8.7311943793911
>> in_miles = 10*0.6213
>>> in_miles
6.212999999999999
>>> in_minutes = 42 + (42/60)
>>> in_minutes
42.7
>>> pace = in_minutes/in_miles
>>> pace
